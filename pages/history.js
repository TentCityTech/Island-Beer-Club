							On a magnificent afternoon, mid-March in 2004, the
							Island Beer Club (IBC) was founded. Jeff "Bones”
							Wilkens (Mbr#1), John “Old Doc” Morton (Mbr#2), John
							“Cruncher” Muncy (Mbr#3) and Wayne “Big Oly”
							Oldendorph (Mbr#4) decided to sample hand-crafted,
							full-bodied beers from local microbreweries in the
							San Diego, California, area. After multiple
							thirst-quenching stops, our four boys ended up at
							the Ballast Point Brewing Company near the
							University of San Diego campus. It was there that a
							kegerator, on display for sale, caught the guys'
							interest. The thought emerged… “Wouldn’t it be cool
							if we could enjoy a cold, hand-crafted, micro-brewed
							beer without the hassle of traveling off of the
							"Rock?"
							<br />
							<br />
							Since great ideas require intense thought and
							discussion, our four-man brew crew adjourned to the
							VFW bar in Coronado, CA for further liquid
							refreshment. At the “V” the team agreed to form a
							beer club. Bones would be the “capital” man--he
							would purchase a kegerator and allow his garage to
							be used for micro brew-beer-sampling sessions. Other
							Club members would purchase kegs of beer, as
							required. Having established the basic charter for
							the club, the guys then adjourned to the Little Club
							bar, in Coronado, to celebrate their brilliant
							thoughts and begin the membership campaign.

							Our man of action, Bones, purchased the kegerator
							just a few days later. And, on Monday, March 22,
							2004, Old Doc delivered the first keg, Ballast Point
							Yellowtail Pale Ale. Shortly thereafter, our
							Original Four designated Rob "Crenny" Crenshaw Fifth
							Founder, who joined in on the afternoon beer
							sampling sessions for Coronado's new beer
							aficionados. He became Member#5 after he purchased
							his first keg.
							<br />
							<br />
							Meeting at 4 pm, the five grew fond of watching
							Jerry Springer (not much else on the tube at that
							time) and discussing the happenings in the universe.
							It was here that the boys developed the IBC
							motto--“More Time than Money” -- to reflect the
							retired status of most of the Beer Club's stately
							members. The Founders also developed the club's
							membership obligation: Buy a keg of hand-crafted
							beer and you are a member. About ten months into our
							new Club activities, we needed to solve a problem
							for Jeff's spousal unit, Loie (aka Mrs. Bones). All
							this time from inception, Club members were allowed
							to visit the restroom facilities in the house.
							Unfortunately, those waiting outside for the
							facility to "clear" would relieve themselves in
							Loie's garden... This was intolerable.

							On the first anniversary of the Beer Club, the first
							urinal was installed. In 2013 the original urinal
							was retired and replaced with a waterless urinal.
							Unfortunately, nowadays, our meeting location may
							not offer a lady's restroom.
							<br />
							<br />
							Always alert and "forward observant" (looking to the
							future), Bones purchased the domain name,
							www.islandbeerclub.com. He knew that it might be
							worthwhile, but he had no idea what to do with it or
							how it would be helpful... so we sat on it until
							July of 2006. At this point, Crenny had gained some
							experience in website development and was hosting
							the website for the Sea 'N Air Men's Golf Club. That
							was all we needed. A few pages were developed, and
							the IBC website was officially published in July
							2006. This award-winning website is the envy of beer
							clubs everywhere.
							<br />
							<br />
							Signage plays a big part at the Island Beer Club. In
							August 2006, our alley became "Beer Belly Blvd." A
							year later a permanent brass marker was installed
							commemorating the site of the IBC Headquarters.
							October 2007 had John Clampitt (Mbr#18) deliver and
							install a hand-crafted, kiln-fired tile plaque to
							identify the clubhouse of the IBC.
							<br />
							<br />
							John Weiman (Mbr#151), Weiman Design, designed our
							logo in late October 2007; allowing us to acquire
							our now highly sought after, custom apparel and
							glassware.
							<br />
							<br />
							In our first fourteen years of existence, we have
							continually improved and upgraded the facility to
							include a commercial popcorn maker (compliments of
							Mike Herlihy (Mbr#57)), two additional beer
							kegerators (thanks Bones (Mbr#1)), a granite wash
							sink (thanks to IBC plumber Bob Ryan (Mbr#120) and
							granite donator Ed Carney (Mbr#58)), two
							flame-thrower outdoor heaters and numerous
							beer-oriented signs. Also, the Island Beer Club
							banner has been on many photo ops including the top
							of Kilimanjaro, 2012 Super Bowl and, a $16 million
							cocaine bust off Costa Rica. Between, 2011 and 2018,
							we more than tripled our membership as we focused on
							recruiting beer aficionados with enough disposable
							income to provide a keg of hand-crafted beer. As of
							June 2020, we have 407 members.
							<br />
							<br />
							Every March, on the Wednesday closest to 22 March,
							we celebrate the anniversary of the Island Beer Club
							by holding a Founders Day party. This event honors
							the five Founders for creating Coronado’s favorite
							weekly alley beer gathering.
							<br />
							<br />
							We lost Jeffery “Bones” Wilkens, (Mbr#1), on 6 Jul
							2019. On 7 Aug 2019, a huge turnout joined together
							in Beer Belly Blvd to recognize Jeff, celebrate his
							life and salute his passion for and contribution to
							the Island Beer Club. On 4 Sep 2019 IBC
							Headquarters, at 851 J Ave, was retired and on the
							same day, we celebrated the Grand Opening of the IBC
							Clubhouse next door at 857 J Ave, Rod Neilson’s (Mbr
							#169) house.
							<br />
							<br />
							The J Ave Clubhouse now hosts Beer Club sessions at
							least twice a month. Other Beer Club sessions are at
							our local venues, VFW Coronado, The Little Club,
							Attitude Brewing Co, and Feast and Fareway
							restaurant at the Coronado Golf Course. On 18 Mar
							2020, because of COVID-19 precautions, Beer Club
							halted weekly meetings until further notice. As of
							23 Jun 2020, no IBC full-membership meeting has been
							conducted at the Clubhouse.
							<br />
							<br />
							Our first order of business when we resume
							alley-socializing is to celebrate Founder’s Day
							2020.
							<br />
							<br />
							The IBC meets every Wednesday from 4 PM to 6 PM
							(Standard Time); 4:30 PM to 6:30 PM (Daylight
							Savings Time) in the alley (Beer Belly Blvd) on J
							Avenue in Coronado as well as our “satellite”
							locations. Guests, especially ladies, are always
							welcome when accompanied by a Beer Club member.
							Please join us.
